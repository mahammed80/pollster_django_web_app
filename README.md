# pollster_django_web_app
The pollster project is a web application that allows users to create polls and vote on them. The project is built on the Django framework, which is a powerful Python web framework that makes it easy to create and maintain web applications.

The pollster project would have the following features:

Admins can create polls with a question and multiple choices.
Users can view polls and vote for one of the choices.
Users can only vote once for each poll.
The results of the poll are displayed after the voting period is over.
The pollster project would be built using the following Django components:

Models: The models would represent the data in the application, such as polls, choices, and votes.
Views: The views would handle the requests from the users, such as creating a new poll, voting on a poll, or viewing the results of a poll.
Templates: The templates would render the HTML for the application's pages, such as the list of polls, the form for creating a new poll, or the results of a poll.
The pollster project would be a valuable tool for any organization that wants to gather feedback from its users. It would be easy to use and maintain, and it would be scalable to handle a large number of polls and users.

Here are some additional benefits of using Django to build a pollster project:

Django is a mature and well-tested framework with a large community of users and developers.
Django is designed for scalability, so it can handle a large number of polls and users.
Django is secure, so it can protect your website from attacks.
Django is easy to learn and use, so you can get your pollster project up and running quickly.
If you are looking to build a pollster project, Django is a great option. It is a powerful, scalable, and secure framework that makes it easy to create and maintain a high-quality application.

Here are the steps on how to run a simple Django project:

Install Django.
Create a Django project.
Create an app for your poll.
Add the poll model to your app.
Create the views for your poll.
